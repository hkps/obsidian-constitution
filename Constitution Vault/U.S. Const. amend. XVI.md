## *Income Tax*

> The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.

> [!INFO] info
> - Superseded [[U.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 4|Article I Section 9 Clause 4]]
> - Removed the 'direct tax' precedent set in [[Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co.]]
> - "the power of Congress to tax income derives from [[U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1|Article I Section 8 Clause 1]], of the original Constitution rather than from the Sixteenth Amendment; the latter simply **eliminated** the requirement that an **income tax, to the extent that it is a direct tax**, must be apportioned among the states" - [[Boris Bittker]]
