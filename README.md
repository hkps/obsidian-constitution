# obsidian-constitution

A file for use with the application [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md) which can display the different elements of the Constitution of the United States of America in an interactive and visual manner. These files may also be integrated into a personal vault to add a quick and easy way to reference the Constitution within Obsidian.

- Each element's filename adheres to [Indigo Book 2.0](https://law.resource.org/pub/us/code/blue/IndigoBook.html) citation format (e.g. `U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 18`) but aliases for each include:
	- a quick-reference name (e.g. `A1S8C18`).
	- a plaintext name (e.g. `Article I Section 8 Clause 18`).
	- relevant clause names (e.g. `Necessary and Proper Clause`).
- The articles, sections, and clauses of the base Constitution are tagged #us-const while the amendments are tagged #us-const-amend to aid with visualization in the Graph view.

## Example Graph

The elements of the original Constitution and the amendments are displayed in different colors using tag-based Groups in the Graph view settings. In the example image, the articles, sections, and clauses of the Constitution are shown as red nodes, while the elements of the amendments are yellow.

To the left of the Graph view is the left sidebar of the application, displaying the files in the Vault, and to the right of the Graph view are the settings being used to specify the appearance of the Graph—under 'Filters,' the 'Tags' are off, 'Attachments' are off, 'Existing files only' is on, 'Orphans' are off; under 'Groups,' two groups exist, one for \"tag:#us-const\" colored red, one for \"tag:#us-const-amend\" colored yellow; under 'Display,' 'Text fade threshold' is set to 1.40, 'Node size' to 1.40, 'Link thickness' to 2.03; under 'Forces,' 'Center force' is set to 0.71, 'Repel force' to 20.00, 'Link force' to 1.00, and 'Link distance' to 30.](/Example%20Graph%20View.png?raw=true "Example Graph View")
